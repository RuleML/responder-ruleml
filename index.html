			Rule Responder is a tool for creating virtual organizations as 
multi-agent systems that support collaborative teams on the Semantic 
Web. 
			It provides the infrastructure for rule-based collaboration between 
the distributed members of such a virtual organization. Human members of
 
			an organization are assisted by semi-autonomous rule-based agents, 
which use Semantic Web rules to describe aspects of their owners' 
derivation and reaction logic.<br><br>

			Each Rule Responder instantiation employs three classes of agents, an
 Organizational Agent (OA), Personal Agents (PAs), and External Agents 
(EAs). 
			The OA represents goals and strategies shared by its virtual 
organization as a whole, using a global rule base that describes its 
policies, regulations,
			opportunities, etc. Each PA assists a single person of the 
organization, (semi-autonomously) acting on his/her behalf by using a 
local knowledge base of 
			derivation rules defined by the person. Each EA uses a Web (HTTP) 
interface, accepting queries from users and passing them to the OA. <br><br>
			
			The OA employs an OWL ontology as a "responsibility assignment 
matrix" to find a PA that can handle an incoming query. The OA uses 
reaction rules to
			send the query to this PA, receive its answer(s), do validation(s), 
and send answer(s) back to the EA.<br><br>
			
			This site contains links to 4 use cases of the Rule Responder system. <a href="WellnessRules/">WellnessRules</a> supports 
			and helps organize a community's wellness related practices. <a href="WellnessRules2/">WellnessRules2</a> expands on upon the original WellnessRules
			with features such as a dynamic weather system. <a href="SymposiumPlanner/SymposiumPlanner.html">SymposiumPlanner</a> assists with the RuleML-20xy Symposia by 
			providing chair members with their own personal agents which answer queries on their behalf. <a href="PatientSupporter/">PatientSupporter</a>
			helps patients form self-help groups for their sports related injuries.<br><br>
